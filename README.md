Each model build from scratch


#### Linear Regression Model
- The model predict a continues target variable y base on one or more independent or predictor variables x
- It uses the equation y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the intercept.

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x
$$


#### Logistic Regression
- it is used for Binary classification problems.
- It calculates the probability of a data point belonging to a class  using the give Sigmoid function

$$
P(y=1|x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x)}}
$$
